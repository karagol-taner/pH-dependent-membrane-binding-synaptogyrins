## pH-Dependent Membrane Binding Specificity of Synaptogyrins 1 and 3 with Distinct Isoelectric Points (pI) Identified by Structural Bioinformatics and Molecular Dynamics

Synaptogyrins are integral membrane proteins involved in neurotransmitter release and synaptic vesicle trafficking; processes essential for neuronal communication. The synaptic vesicles maintain an acidic environment (~pH 5.5) due to the action of proton pumps (V-ATPases) that actively transport protons (H‚Å∫) into the vesicles. This creates a proton gradient, which is essential for neurotransmitter storage, as the acidic pH facilitates the proton-coupled transport of neurotransmitters into the vesicles. Notably, the pH of synaptic vesicles increases from ~5.5 to ~7.25 upon neuronal activation, making pH a crucial factor in our investigation. Synaptogyrin-1 and synaptogyrin-3 were selected for this study because of their structural similarities and distinct isoelectric points (pI), which could result in differential interactions with the lipid environments of neural vesicles. We conducted molecular dynamics simulations to examine the binding specificity of these isoforms across two types of vesicle systems: synaptic vesicles (SVs) with active pH of 7.25 and resting pH of 5.5. Our results reveal that synaptogyrin 1 and 3 display distinct, pH-dependent membrane binding specificities, with their interactions varying significantly between synaptic vesicles. Understanding these interactions is crucial, as the pI of a protein can significantly influence its electrostatic interactions with membrane lipids, thereby affecting its binding affinity and specificity. This suggests that the electrostatic properties of synaptogyrins, influenced by their pI, are crucial in determining their binding preferences in differential environmental stages of neurons upon activation. The study highlights the importance of pI and membrane composition in modulating synaptogyrin activity, offering new perspectives on their contributions to synaptic function and neurosecretion. Our finding suggests altered pH homeostasis, which could be seen in Alzheimer's and seizures, could disrupt synaptogyrin binding and contribute to neuronal dysregulation. These findings further advance our comprehension of the molecular mechanisms underlying membrane specificity and the regulation of synaptic proteins.
